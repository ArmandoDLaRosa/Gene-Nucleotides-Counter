# Gene-Nucleotides-Python_Counter-with-"Re_Library"

Python Script

Input: fasta file with a gene's nucleotide sequence. 

Output: 
        Total nucleotides (ACTG).
        
        Adenosine Percentage in the gene.
        Cytosine Percentage in the gene.
        Thymine Percentage in the gene.
        Guanine Percentage in the gene.
        
        Re (regular expressions) library application:
        
          The script checks the longest sequence of repeated nucleotides for each of the A, C, T and G nucleotides. 
          It also checks the times the longest sequence appears in the gene.
