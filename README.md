# FINDING GENE's LONGEST NUCLEOTIDES SEQUENCES using "Re_Library".

Python Script - this repo comes with 2 inputs files (TTN gene and APC gene).

Input: Fasta file with a gene's nucleotide sequence. 

Output: 
        
        Total nucleotides (ACTG).
        
        Adenosine Percentage in the gene.
        Cytosine Percentage in the gene.
        Thymine Percentage in the gene.
        Guanine Percentage in the gene.
        
        Re (regular expressions) library application:
        
          The script checks the longest sequence of repeated nucleotides for each of the A, C, T and G nucleotides. 
          It tells how long is that sequence, and also checks the times it appears in the gene.
